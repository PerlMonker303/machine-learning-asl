<h1>ASL Recognizer</h1>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
  ASL stands for "American Sign Language" is a widely used sign language for those requiring hearing and speaking aids. Similar to spoken languages, ASL also uses letters which one may express using one hand and no motion (except for letter Z).
  <br>
  Using my knowledge regarding Deep Learning I trained an Artifical Neural Network to smartly predict ASL signs based on an image input of a hand. The images are of size 28x28 and the data set was taken from <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datamunge/sign-language-mnist">here</a>.
